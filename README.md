# FormsFilling

Forms Filling with visual editor
I'm starting this project because I didn't find examples of how to build code to fill in a form in a web application.
The need I had was to fill out federal forms such as W4, I9 from data in a database.

THIS PROJECT IS NOT A STAND ALONE PROGRAM. THIS IS TO DEMONSTRATE HOW TO WRITE THE CODE.I haven't tried to run this on its own. I simply pulled a bunch of code from an existing project.

This project runs only on Windows servers. It does not run on Linux servers.

This project is to show how to build code that fills in forms.

To fill in forms, the following are needed:
a. The background image which is the form to fill in
b. A listing of all the fields to fill in
c. The formatting of each field
d. The code to draw the data that goes in each field
e. The font information for the form

It really helps to have a visual editor to lay out the location of each field on the form.

Improvements that could be done:
This version uses a single font for the whole form. An obvious improvement would be to have different fonts for each field.

This version does not make sure that the data does not go beyond the field.

This version can only handle certain image formats.
